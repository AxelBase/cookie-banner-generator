Instead of simplifying compliance, most banners overwhelm users with jargon, unnecessary toggles, and confusing consent flows. This complexity discourages adoption and leaves businesses exposed to risk.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">The Problem with Over-Engineered Banners</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Enterprise-level compliance tools assume every business needs advanced consent management. In reality, SMBs usually just need a clear, legally sound banner that informs users and records consent. Over-engineered solutions add dashboards, integrations, and legalese that most founders neither understand nor need.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Impact on Customer Experience</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Complicated banners frustrate customers. Long-winded consent forms and intrusive pop-ups lead to banner fatigue. Instead of building trust, they drive users away, reducing conversions and damaging credibility.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">A Simpler Approach</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Our Cookie Banner Text Generator solves this by focusing on plain language, compliance essentials, and user-friendly design. It strips away unnecessary complexity, leaving a banner that meets legal requirements while keeping customers engaged.</p> <h3 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Key Takeaways</h3> <ul class="svelte-1tq17n3"><li class="svelte-1tq17n3">SMBs don’t need enterprise-level consent management.</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Complex banners reduce trust and conversions.</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Simplified, compliant text is often enough.</li></ul> <p class="italic-note svelte-1tq17n3">Compliance doesn’t have to be complicated. With the right tools, small businesses can stay protected and keep customers happy.</p></article></div>');function O(m){var e=C();b("1tq17n3",u=>{var a=w(),v=g(h(a),6);s(4),o(()=>i(v,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post1`)),f(()=>{y.title="Why Most Cookie Banners Are Too Complicated | AxelBase Blog"}),n(u,a)});var t=r(e),d=r(t);s(4),l(t),s(2),l(e),o(()=>i(d,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),n(m,e)}export{O as component,M as universal};
