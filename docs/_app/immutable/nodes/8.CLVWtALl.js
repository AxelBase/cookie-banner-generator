But in 2025, it’s no longer viable for many SMBs. Privacy regulations, cookie consent requirements, and technical complexity have made it more of a liability than a solution. The good news? There are privacy-safe alternatives that deliver actionable insights without requiring consent banners.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">Why Google Analytics Fell Behind</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">GDPR and CCPA made cookie-based tracking harder to justify. Customers increasingly reject consent banners, leaving businesses with incomplete data. Google’s reliance on personal identifiers has become a compliance headache.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">Better Alternatives</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Modern analytics tools focus on privacy-first tracking. They use aggregated, anonymized data to provide insights without storing personal information. This means you can measure traffic, conversions, and engagement without worrying about fines or customer backlash.</p> <h3 class="svelte-1li990r">Recommended Tools</h3> <ul class="svelte-1li990r"><li class="svelte-1li990r">Plausible Analytics – lightweight, open-source, and cookie-free.</li> <li class="svelte-1li990r">Fathom Analytics – simple dashboards with strong privacy guarantees.</li> <li class="svelte-1li990r">Matomo – self-hosted option for full control over your data.</li></ul> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1li990r"><summary class="svelte-1li990r">Do I still need a cookie banner?</summary> <p class="svelte-1li990r">No, these tools don’t require consent because they don’t track personal data.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1li990r"><summary class="svelte-1li990r">Are they as powerful as Google Analytics?</summary> <p class="svelte-1li990r">For SMBs, yes. They cover the metrics that matter most without unnecessary complexity.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1li990r"><summary class="svelte-1li990r">Is setup difficult?</summary> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Most tools offer simple installation, often just a single script tag.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-1li990r">Analytics should empower, not burden. Privacy-first tools are the future of SMB data tracking.</p></article></div>');function x(p){var e=_();b("1li990r",v=>{var a=A(),h=u(y(a),6);s(4),i(()=>n(h,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post5`)),g(()=>{f.title="Google Analytics Is Dead – Here’s What to Use in 2025 | AxelBase Blog"}),l(v,a)});var t=o(e),d=o(t);s(4),r(t),s(2),r(e),i(()=>n(d,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),l(p,e)}export{x as component,T as universal};
