Most templates are too long, too legalistic, and too confusing for customers. The truth is, you don’t need a 20-page document to be compliant—you need a short, clear policy that explains cookies in plain English. That’s why we created a 30-second cookie policy: lawyer-reviewed, under 600 words, and ready to paste into your store.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">Why Short Policies Work</h2> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Customers rarely read long cookie policies. A concise version respects their time, builds trust, and still meets compliance requirements. Regulators care about transparency, not word count.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">What’s Inside</h2> <p class="svelte-led0iy">The 30-second policy covers the essentials: what cookies are, why they’re used, and how customers can opt out. It avoids jargon and focuses on customer benefits, like improved shopping experiences and personalized recommendations.</p> <h3 class="svelte-led0iy">Key Features</h3> <ul class="svelte-led0iy"><li class="svelte-led0iy">Lawyer-reviewed for GDPR and CCPA compliance.</li> <li class="svelte-led0iy">Written in plain English for accessibility.</li> <li class="svelte-led0iy">Copy-paste ready for Shopify and other platforms.</li></ul> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-led0iy"><summary class="svelte-led0iy">Is this policy enough for compliance?</summary> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Yes, for most SMBs. It covers the core requirements without unnecessary complexity.</p></details> <details class="svelte-led0iy"><summary class="svelte-led0iy">Can I customize it?</summary> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Absolutely.
